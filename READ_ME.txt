To compile the code, type "make" into the command line. That will create an executable named plagiarismCatcher, to run the program type in the command line "./plagiarismCatcher /path/to/files/ 6 200" where /path/to/files/ is the path to the directory that has the files to be checked for cheaters and make sure to include slashes at the beginning and end of the filepath, and the 6 is the size of the chunks, and 200 is the cutoff for number of matching chunks to be considered plagiarized. The names of the files are plagCatcher.cpp, hashTable.cpp, and hashTable.h
